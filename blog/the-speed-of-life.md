title: The Speed of Life
---
In science that day, Dr. Pavlica had mentioned the speed of light, and I'd heard “the speed of life”. While he was going on about E = mc2, I was thinking again about how crazy it is that life just speeds along, sunrise after sunrise, season after season. Whether you're totally miserable or insanely happy, the months keep coming, crashing like waves. There are no do-overs, no backsides, and bad stuff happens. But then I thought, *Wait. Good stuff happens to. And sometimes, even a kiss can slow time down.*
